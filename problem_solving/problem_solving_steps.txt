PROBLEM SOLVING STEPS:

- Understand the problem
  - make questions

- Explore concrete examples
  - implement examples of how it will work
  - what the inputs and outputs gonna look like
  - find the edge cases of the problem

- Break it down
  - find the basic steps that will solve the problem
  - write comments with these steps in order

- Solve / Simplify
  - solve the problem
  - if there are steps that you cannot solve right now skip them or split them into more steps
  - make a research for those steps that you are struggling on

- Look back and refactor
  - make your solution more readable
  - use modern and simpler syntax if you can
  - make optimizations in order to improve space and time complexity
